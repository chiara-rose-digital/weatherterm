# About

Weatherterm is a simple cli client to get the weather for your location. Once installed all you have to do is enter `weather` in your terminal to get the information printed nicely in you terminal. You get the current temperature, humidity and wind speed.

# Installation

`npm i -g weatherterm`

NOTE: Make sure you have npm/node installed on your machine.

# Future Development/Notes

Right now I use the Open Weather Map API to get the information. They provide png file names in their response and I want to get these to be displayed in the body as well. Additionally, other options such as getting weather for the week, or specifiying another location are also in the works.
